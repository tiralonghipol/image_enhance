# Image Enhancement Tools
ROS container of different methods and techniques to enhance an input image stream in low light conditions

## Implemented Methods

- Matlab low light image enhancement
    - original dehaze cpp code: https://github.com/ZQPei/Haze_Removal_cpp
    - algorithm theory: https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/low-light-image-enhancement.html
-  Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
    - Based on OpenCV: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d6/db6/classcv_1_1CLAHE.html



### Note
A dynamic reconfigure server can be called from the launch file to test different paramters online
